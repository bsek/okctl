# Release 0.0.16

## Features
- OKCTL_PS1 can now refer to `%env` which will be replaced with okctl environment.

## Bugfixes
- https://github.com/godaddy/kubernetes-external-secrets/ moved to --> https://github.com/external-secrets/kubernetes-external-secrets This has been updated in the code so external secrets will continue to work.
- `okctl show credentials` contained weird text `&{0xc0000b0120}`, this is now removed.
- Setting OKCTL_PS1 in `okctl venv` didn't work properly because of missing quotes in the resulting subshell's PS1. This
is now fixed.
